# Blender-3D-Scenes
Some 3D scenes and objects I made using blender. Every object that will be presented here is fully made by me, from modelling to texturing and rendering.
The most time spent on a scene is about a week, so most of them are medium - sized projects.
There are no modells based on tutorials, every project teached me something different.
