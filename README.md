# Blender-3D-Scenes
Some 3D scenes and objects I made using blender. Every object that will be presented here is fully made by me, from modelling to texturing and rendering.
The most time spent on a scene is about a week, so most of them are medium - sized projects.
There are no modells based on tutorials, every project teached me something different.

All of the folders contain two .blend files and a final render to preview the project.
There aro also two additional files: 
  TEXTURES contains every texture that I have used. Some may be used in one or more modells.
  HDRIS contains different hdri's that can appear in the projects

Websites I used for searching textures and hdri's:
